Such mistakes are called mutations. The mutations cause degeneration of rod photoreceptors which are responsible for vision in dim illumination resulting in night blindness. After rod photoreceptors are eliminated, gradual degeneration of cone photoreceptors occurs resulting in gradual constriction of side vision that eventually causes tunnel vision. Oxidative stress contributes to cone degeneration. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reduces oxidative stress and in animal models of RP it slowed cone degeneration. In a phase I clinical trial in patients with RP, NAC taken by month for 6 months caused some small improvements in two different vision tests suggesting that long-term administration of NAC might slow cone degeneration in RP. NAC Attack is a clinical trial being conducted at many institutions in the US, Canada, Mexico, and Europe designed to determine if taking NAC for several years provides benefit in patients with RP.","detailedDescription":"Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a disease in which one of several different mutations differentially causes degeneration of rod photoreceptors while sparing cone photoreceptors. The loss of rod photoreceptors results in poor vision in dim illumination (night blindness), but does not affect most activities of daily life including reading or driving. However, after most rod photoreceptors are eliminated, cone photoreceptors begin to die, resulting in gradual constriction of visual fields which over time causes visual disability.\n\nRods outnumber cones by a ratio of 95:5 and therefore after mutation-induced degeneration of rods, the majority of cells in the outer retina have been eliminated, markedly reducing oxygen utilization. However, oxygen supply is unchanged resulting in a large excess of tissue oxygen surrounding cones. This results in progressive oxidative damage that contributes to slowly progressive degeneration of cone photoreceptors. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a strong antioxidant that is approved for acetaminophen overdose. Orally administered NAC in a mouse model of RP reduced oxidative damage to cones and promoted maintenance of function and survival of cones. In a phase I clinical trial in patients with RP, oral administration of NAC for 6 months was well-tolerated and resulted in a small but statistically significant improvement in visual acuity and light sensitivity in the retina. This suggests that long-term administration of NAC may promote survival and maintenance of function of cones. NAC Attack is a phase III, multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled trial that will determine if oral NAC provides benefit and is safe in patients with RP."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Retinitis Pigmentosa"],"keywords":["N-acetylcysteine","Ellipsoid zone","Macular sensitivity","Best corrected visual acuity","Ellipsoid zone width","Ellipsoid zone area","Oxidative damage","Usher Syndrome","Antioxidants"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"438 participants will be enrolled and randomized at approximately 30 clinical sites in the Americas and Europe.

The primary outcome measure is the progressive change (loss) in EZ width measured as the cumulative loss of EZ (calculated as the area above the curve) between baseline and month (M) 45.","timeFrame":"Baseline and 45 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in mean macular sensitivity measured by microperimetry (MP)","description":"The macula is the functional center of the retina. Macular sensitivity is a measure of the sensitivity to light assessed at focal points within the macula. It is measured by microperimetry (MP), a test in which light stimuli of many different intensities are presented at multiple loci in the macula and the response or lack of response to those stimuli are recorded. Sensitivity is determined by the weakest light stimulus that is detected at a locus. The mean macular sensitivity is the average of the sensitivity measurements at the test loci and provides a quantitative assessment of macula function.","timeFrame":"Baseline and 45 months"},{"measure":"Change in best-corrected visual acuity","description":"Visual acuity is the vision mediated by the fovea (the center of the macula) that is used for fine visual tasks including reading and driving. In order to measure the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), it is necessary to eliminate all refractive error with lenses to optimally focus images on the fovea. This is done using a standardized protocol established in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS); it measures the number of letters read at 4 meters on a standardized chart under standardized lighting conditions. Since the fovea is made up of cones, BCVA is a measure of cone function.","timeFrame":"Baseline and 45 months"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cumulative change of EZ area assessed as the area above curve (AAC)","description":"EZ area is determined by measuring EZ width of multiple horizontal SD-OCT scans ranging from the superior to the inferior part of the macula.

The cells are called neural progenitor cells, which are a type of stem cell that can become several different types of cells in the nervous system. These cells have been derived to specifically become astrocytes, which is a type of neuronal cell. The cells are called \"CNS10-NPC.\" The investigational treatment has been tested in animals, but it has not yet been tested in people. In this study, the investigators want to learn if CNS10-NPC cells are safe to transplant into the subretinal space of people.","detailedDescription":"This study will be the first to use a human progenitor cell line to treat retinitis pigmentosa in people. This is a Phase 1/2a, single-center, open label, safety study of two escalating doses of human neural progenitor cells (CNS10-NPC) delivered unilaterally to the subretinal space of subjects with RP.\n\nSubjects meeting all Eligibility Criteria and providing Informed Consent will be enrolled in one of two sequential dosing groups. Subjects will be treated sequentially with a minimum of one month interval between surgeries for the first three subjects in each dosing cohort. The remaining subjects in the cohort will be treated with a minimum interval of at least one week between surgeries.\n\nPrimary objective. To assess the safety and tolerability of two escalating doses of clinical grade human fetal cortical-derived neural progenitor cells (CNS10-NPC) administered in the subretinal space of one eye (unilaterally) in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP).\n\nSecondary objectives. Within constraints of a small first in-human study focused on safety:\n\n1. Determine if CNS10-NPC can engraft and survive long-term in the retina of transiently immunosuppressed subjects,\n2. Obtain evidence that subretinal injection of CNS10-NPC can favorably impact the progression of vision loss in subjects with moderate RP."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Retinitis Pigmentosa"],"keywords":["RP","Retinopathy","Pigmentary Retinopathy","Retinal Degeneration"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group 1A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Visual acuity of 20/200 or worse\n\nSingle, unilateral, subretinal injection of 300,000 CNS10-NPC (n=3)","interventionNames":["Biological: CNS10-NPC implantation"]},{"label":"Group 1B","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Visual acuity of 20/200 or worse\n\nSingle, unilateral, subretinal injection of 1,000,000 CNS10-NPC (n=3)","interventionNames":["Biological: CNS10-NPC implantation"]},{"label":"Group 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Visual acuity between 20/80 and 20/200\n\nSingle, unilateral, subretinal injection of 1,000,000 CNS10-NPC (n=10)","interventionNames":["Biological: CNS10-NPC implantation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"CNS10-NPC implantation","description":"All patients will receive a single, unilateral, subretinal injection of CNS10-NPC","armGroupLabels":["Group 1A","Group 1B","Group 2"],"otherNames":["Neural Progenitor Cell (NPC)","Stem Cell"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Safety as evaluated by incidence of Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and their relationship to the intervention","timeFrame":"Subjects will be followed postoperatively for 12 months"},{"measure":"Safety, as evaluated by changes in the complete blood count","timeFrame":"Subjects will be followed postoperatively for 12 months"},{"measure":"Safety, as evaluated by changes in the comprehensive metabolic panel","timeFrame":"Subjects will be followed postoperatively for 12 months"},{"measure":"Safety, as evaluated by changes in Donor Specific Antibodies","timeFrame":"Subjects will be followed postoperatively for 12 months"},{"measure":"Safety, as evaluated by changes in the urinalysis","timeFrame":"Subjects will be followed postoperatively for 12 months"},{"measure":"Safety, as evaluated by changes in Visual Acuity","description":"ETRDS, or FrACT in cases of very low vision.","timeFrame":"Subjects will be followed postoperatively for 12 months"},{"measure":"Safety, as evaluated by changes in visual field","description":"Goldman perimetry will be used for central visual fields and microperimetry will be used for peripheral visual fields","timeFrame":"Subjects will be followed postoperatively for 12 months"},{"measure":"Safety, as evaluated by changes in Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT)","description":"Ellipsoid zone measurement through SD-OCT will be performed","timeFrame":"Subjects will be followed postoperatively for 12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Slit lamp examination","timeFrame":"Performed 7 times over 15 months"},{"measure":"Intraocular pressure measurement","timeFrame":"Performed 7 times over 15 months"},{"measure":"Funduscopic examination","timeFrame":"Performed 7 times over 15 months"},{"measure":"Fundus photography (color, red free, or infrared)","timeFrame":"Performed 4 times over 15 months"},{"measure":"Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF)","timeFrame":"Performed 4 times over 15 months"},{"measure":"Best Corrected Visual Acuity","timeFrame":"Performed 7 times over 15 months"},{"measure":"Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (VFQ-25)","description":"The Visual Function Questionnaire-25 is graded in a scale from 0-100 where a higher number represents better function","timeFrame":"Performed 5 times over 15 months"},{"measure":"Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)","description":"Retinal Thickness","timeFrame":"Performed 5 times over 15 months"},{"measure":"Electroretinography (ERG)","timeFrame":"Performed 5 times over 15 months"},{"measure":"Goldmann visual field area (microperimetry)","timeFrame":"Performed 5 times over 15 months"},{"measure":"Change in rate of vision field loss","timeFrame":"Through study completion, ~15 months."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

Substages within the advanced stage are defined as follows (monocular measurements, horizontal axis of isopter III4e for the visual field):\n\n   * Severe stage is defined by both a BCVA below or equal to 20/200 and above or equal to 20/800, and a visual field below or equal to 20 degrees (subjects of Cohorts 1 to 3)\n   * Intermediate stage is defined by both a BCVA below or equal to 20/40 and above 20/200, and a visual field below or equal to 20 degrees (subjects of Cohorts 4 to 6)\n5. For subjects with severe advanced RCD enrolled in Step 1 only, the difference in visual acuity between the two eyes of a given subject should be equal to or below 0.3 logarithm of the minimal angle (LogMAR) (≤3 ETDRS lines), with a tolerance margin of 3 ETDRS letters.\n6. Clinical diagnosis of RCD based on past medical and family history, mid-peripheral visual field dysfunction, photopsia, night blindness (nyctalopia), and fundoscopic appearance (including but not restricted to bone spicule pigmentation, attenuation of the retinal vessels, and waxy pallor of the optic nerve).\n7. Diagnosis of RCD is confirmed on prior full-field ERG (any previously performed ERG is acceptable).\n8. Documented preservation of cone inner and outer segments considered good enough by the investigator for the subject to be included in the study.\n9. Negative serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential (please refer to Schedule of Assessments for details).\n10. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men and/or their partner(s) of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective contraceptive method. This applies to the time period between ICF signature and 12 months after SPVN06 subretinal injection SRI (i.e., no longer applicable to subjects of Cohort 4 after randomization). The definition of highly effective contraceptive methods follows CTFG recommendations. Highly effective contraceptive methods are limited to:\n\n    * Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:\n\n      * Oral\n      * Intravaginal\n      * Transdermal\n    * Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:\n\n      * Oral\n      * Injectable\n      * Implantable\n    * Intrauterine device (IUD)\n    * Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)\n    * Bilateral tubal occlusion\n    * Vasectomized partner\n    * Sexual abstinence\n11. Subjects must be affiliated to a health security system, if they are included in a clinical site based in France (per law).\n12. No out-of-range values for clinical laboratory tests, however, if outside, must be considered as non-clinically relevant by the investigator using a multidisciplinary approach and compatible with a participation in the clinical study.\n13. 12-lead electrocardiogram within normal limits, however, when outside, must be documented by the investigator using a multidisciplinary approach as not clinically relevant and compatible with a participation in the clinical study. Nota bene: This criterion of eligibility is only applicable to subjects assigned to a treatment cohort (Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6), and is not required to authorize randomization in Step 2.\n14. Physical examination without any clinical findings of clinical relevance (per medical/anesthesia staffs judgment) that could compromise participation in the clinical study or could affect the collection and/or evaluation of the study parameters. The findings of clinical relevance considered as contraindications to SPVN06 treatment include, but are not limited to, pulmonary pathology such as COPD, asthma, cardiac conditions such as congestive heart failure or valve disease, renal issues such as renal insufficiency and endocrine issues such as diabetes.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nSubjects are not eligible to participate in this study if any of the following criteria apply:\n\n1. Subjects with prior administration of any gene therapy or any previous treatment with stem cell therapy for ocular or non-ocular disease.\n2. Subjects participating in another clinical trial and receiving an investigational medicinal product (IMP) within 5 half-lives or 90 days prior to the injection of SPVN06.\n3. Subjects with RCD due to any mutation in genes other than those listed in the inclusion criteria.\n4.

Subjects of reproductive potential unwilling to use effective contraception starting right after ICF signature and for 12 months after SPVN06 SRI (i.e., no longer applicable to subjects of Cohort 4 after randomization).\n11. Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n12. Subjects who are unwilling or unable (based on the investigator's judgment) to comply with the study protocol.\n13. Subjects with any condition that would not allow them to complete follow-up examinations during the study and, in the opinion of the investigator, would make them unsuitable for the study.\n14. Subjects positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or any other systemic immunocompromising disease.\n15. Subjects who have undergone, within 6 months before inclusion, any significant ocular surgery (per investigator's judgment) that could interfere with the evaluation of SPVN06 study objectives.\n16.

The investigators will study how effectively the SLAM technology enables the visual prosthesis system to construct a map of the user's environment and locate the user within that map. The technology will be tested both with normally sighted individuals donning a virtual reality headset and with retinal prosthesis users (Argus II).","detailedDescription":"About 1.3 million Americans aged 40 and older are legally blind, a majority because of diseases with onset later in life, such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. Second Sight Medical Products (SSMP) has developed the world's first FDA approved retinal implant, Argus II, intended to restore some functional vision for people suffering from retinitis pigmentosa (RP). In this era of smart devices, generic navigation technology, such as GPS mapping apps for smartphones, can provide directions to help guide a blind user from point A to point B. However, these navigational aids do little to enable blind users to form an egocentric understanding of the surroundings, are not suited to navigation indoors, and do nothing to assist in avoiding obstacles to mobility. The Argus II, on the other hand, provides blind users with a limited visual representation of their surroundings that improves users' ability to orient themselves and traverse obstacles, yet lacks features for high-level navigation and semantic interpretation of the surroundings. The proposed study aims to address these limitations of the Argus II through a synergy of state-of-the-art simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object recognition technologies.\n\nThis study is driven by the hypothesis that navigation for users of retinal prosthetics can be greatly improved by incorporating SLAM and object recognition technology conveying environmental information via a retinal prosthesis and auditory feedback. SLAM enables the visual prosthesis system to construct a map of the user's environment and locate the user within that map. The system then provides object location and navigational cues via appropriate sensory modalities enabling the user to mentally form an egocentric map of the environment. Investigators will develop and test a visual prosthesis system which 1) constructs a map of unfamiliar environments and localizes the user using SLAM technology 2) automatically identifies navigationally-relevant objects and landmarks using object recognition and 3) provides sensory feedback for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and object/landmark identification."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Retinitis Pigmentosa","Visual Impairment","Visual Prosthesis"],"keywords":["Retinal Prosthesis","Argus II"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":35,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Navigation system for users of a visual prosthesis","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This intervention will assess the feasibility of using a navigation system to aid blind users of a visual prosthesis with navigation tasks, by using the navigation system to provide navigational cues through multiple sensory modalities including vision and audition.

As the first step toward developing evidence-based practice for managing implant patients with USH, this study evaluates local neural health, as well as the neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN in implanted patients with USH.

Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning techniques to develop an objective tool for assessing the electrode-neuron interface at individual electrode locations.","detailedDescription":"Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hearing loss, visual impairment, and in some cases, vestibular dysfunction. It is the leading cause of hereditary deaf-blindness in humans. USH causes extensive degeneration in the cochlear nerve (CN), especially in CN fibers innervating the base of the cochlea. Whereas there is no treatment for arresting this degenerative process or for restoring visual loss, the restoration of auditory input is possible with cochlear implantation. Due to the progressive deterioration in vision, using visual cues for communication will eventually become impossible. Therefore, the importance of optimizing auditory inputs through cochlear implants (CIs) for patients with USH is paramount. However, patients with USH have much higher rates of neurological, mental, or behavioral disorders than the general CI patient population, which limits their ability to provide reliable behavioral responses or sufficient verbal descriptions of their auditory perception, especially for pediatric patients. In addition, optimal programming parameters for CI users with CN damage differ from those used in typical CI users due to declined CN responsiveness to electrical stimulation. As a result, the clinical programming process in implanted patients with USH can be extremely challenging. To date, auditory neural encoding of electrical stimulation in patients with USH has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, the field lacks evidence-based practice guidelines for managing implanted patients with USH. For patients who cannot provide reliable feedback, clinicians rely on a \"trial-and-error\" approach for adjusting CI programming settings, which ultimately may not result in appropriate programming maps for individual patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop objective clinical tools for optimizing CI settings for these patients. As the first step toward developing evidence-based practice for managing patients with USH, this study evaluates local neural health, as well as the neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN in implanted patients with USH. Aim 1 will determine local CN health in patients with USH by assessing the sensitivity of the electrically evoked compound action potential to changes in interphase gap and pulse polarity. Aim 2 will determine group differences in neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN between patients with USH and patients with idiopathic hearing loss. Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning techniques to develop an objective tool for assessing the electrode-neuron interface at individual electrode locations. Results of this study have high scientific significance because they will establish how CN degeneration affects neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation, and identify tests that distinguish the loss of spiral ganglion neurons from the loss of peripheral axons. Results of this study also have high clinical significance because they will 1) lay the groundwork for developing effective, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for managing patients with USH, and 2) yield an objective tool for assessing the site-specific electrode-neuron interface in all CI users, which is foundational for creating optimal programming maps for individual patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Usher Syndrome","Cochlear Implantation"],"keywords":["Auditory
